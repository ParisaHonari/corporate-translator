⚠️ **Disclaimer (read before you copy-paste this to your boss):**  
This app is for **fun, humor, and a sprinkle of sarcasm**. It translates corporate language into what people *might* actually mean — not what you should say out loud.

Do NOT use this in real-life professional situations unless you enjoy awkward silences, HR meetings, or sudden calendar invites titled *“Quick Chat.”*

Use at your own risk.  
If it makes you look brilliant — built by Parisa Honari.  
If it gets you in trouble — this app does not exist. 🙂
